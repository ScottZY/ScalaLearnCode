Notes and details:
1) Null class has only one instance object——null, similar to the null reference in Java.
   null can be assigned to any reference type (AnyRef), but not to value
   types (AnyVal: such as Int, Float, Char, Boolean, Long, Double, Byte, Short)
2) The Unit type is used to identify a process, that is a function that does not have an explicit return value.
   Unit has only one instance (), and this instance has no real meaning.
3) Nothing can be used as the return type of method that does not have a normal return value,
   which tells you intuitively that the method will not return normally, and since Nothing is a subclass
   of any other type, it is also compatible with methods that require a return value.
